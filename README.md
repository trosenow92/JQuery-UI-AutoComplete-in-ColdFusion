# JQuery-UI-AutoComplete-in-ColdFusion
JQuery-UI has a cool autocomplete feature. I was never able to find a good, working version in ColdFusion so I fixed up a bad one.


This particular Autocomplete grabs an athlete's name from a database along with the year of their retirement, which is added to the struct and returned along with the name.
